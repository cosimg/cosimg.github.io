The Conflict Simulation Group, located at the **University of Würzburg**, Germany, has begun using conflict simulations as an educational tool in 2011. Since then, the group has developed a number of rule sets addressing various topics, and conducted research on the history of conflict simulations in military training. Beside our regular teaching activities at the University of Würzburg, we have organized war games at other locations, including **Helmut Schmidt University**, the **GIDS** in Hamburg, the **German Army Warfighting Simulation Centre** in Wildflecken and the **German Army's Infantry School** in Hammelburg.

**Jorit Wintjes** studied Ancient and Contemporary History, Latin and ancient Greek at the University of Würzburg. He wrote a PhD thesis on the Antiochene orator Libanius and a *Habilitationsschrift* on Roman naval operations in north-western Europe. His research interests include ancient and pre-WWI military history, the role of women in warfare and the use of conflict simulations in officer training. He is a professor at the Würzburg [Ancient History Department](http://www.geschichte.uni-wuerzburg.de/institut/alte-geschichte/) teaching in the history and digital humanities programmes.

**Steffen Pielström** studied biology at the University of Würzburg. He wrote a PhD thesis on organization processes, information use and decision making in ant societies. His current research interests include computational text analysis, the application of quantitative methodology in humanities research, and the simulation and modelling of conflicts. He currently works as a project coordinator at the [Department of Literary Computing](https://www.germanistik.uni-wuerzburg.de/lehrstuehle/computerphilologie/startseite/) and teaches data analysis skills in the digital humanities programme.

**Pia Henning** studied Digital Humanities and German Literature at the University of Würzburg. For her Master thesis she digitized the available German *Kriegsspiel* rule sets to machine readable TEI and produced the first linguistic analysis of the rule sets as a texts genre. For her PhD thesis, she is developing an ontology for the annotation of rule sets and prepares a digital edition for diachronic and comparative analysis. She is currently working as a data engineer.
